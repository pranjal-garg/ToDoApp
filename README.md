## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Flutter (UI toolkit)
- Dart (Programming Language)
- SQLite (Local database using sqflite)
- intl (Date formatting)
- Material Design (UI components)


## 💡 How it Works

- The app initializes with data fetched from SQLite.
- You can check/uncheck tasks. The UI updates instantly:
- ✔️ Completed tasks move to the bottom with a blue color and strikethrough.
- ❌ Incomplete tasks stay on top with black color and normal text.
- Add a new task using the "+" button in the AppBar.
- Delete any task with the trash icon.
- All tasks are persisted locally using SQLite, so no data is lost on app restart.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- No cloud sync or online backup.
- Basic UI without animations.

## 🏗️ Future Improvements

- Add notifications/reminders for due tasks.
- Cloud sync with Firebase.
- Dark mode support.
- Task categorization and priorities.
- Improved animations and transitions.
## 🏃 Getting Started
